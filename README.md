# Super Calculator

## 👀 What is it?
A simple calculator! All it does is open a Java GUI and allows you to input a simple operation and get an answer. Simple, easy and quick!

## 🕔 What's to come?
- Add more language! So more cases are covered.
- I also plan support for decimals and more complex operations like square roots, modulus, etc.
- I plan to add support for negative numbers and fractions as well.
- I also plan to add brackets/parentheses supports

## ✅ What's been added?
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- Natural language so you can just type 1 plus 1 and get 2!
- I hav added multi-number support so you can do 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 and get 10! (BIDMAS/BODMAS is supported, however, brackets are not supported yet)

## 🔽 How to download?
You can download it by going to the [releases](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/SuperCalculator/releases) page and downloading the latest version for your OS.
However, if you already have Java installed, I **strongly recommend** you download the .jar file instead, as this will save **a lot of space**  
Just go to [releases](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/SuperCalculator/releases) and find the latest .jar file!
