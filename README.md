# Super Calculator

## 👀 What is it?
A simple calculator! All it does is open a Java GUI and allows you to input a simple operation and get an answer. Simple, easy and quick!

## 🕔 What's to come?
I plan to add natural language so you can just type 1 plus 1 and get 2!  
I also plan to support bigger calculations rather than just 2 numbers ( which it is currently limited to ).

## 🔽 How to download?
You can download it by clicking [here](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/SuperCalculator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
Then run the SuperCalculator.app file under the output folder.  
However, if you already have Java installed, I **strongly recommend** you [download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jlu7tydnk3n05z9/SuperCalculator.jar/file) the [.jar](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jlu7tydnk3n05z9/SuperCalculator.jar/file) file instead, as this will save **a lot of space**
